## ToDo
* Have fun, make pictures. 
* Use more images for training (current state is proof of concept)
* Color?

## Reference

* [Rubikscode](https://rubikscode.net/2019/01/21/generating-images-using-adversarial-autoencoders-and-python/) - Intuitive [Keras](https://keras.io) implementation of the adversarial autoencoder.
